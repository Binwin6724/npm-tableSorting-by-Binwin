## Things to look before

In order to get this work there are some requirements that needed to be met.

## Requirements
* Table class name must be : table-sortable ```<table class = "table-sortable">```
* Table heading must be inside thead : ```<thead><tr><th>example header</th></tr></thead>```

## How things works :-
* We need to run [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sort-table-with-binwin "sort-table-with-binwin") command to get the package to your project.

    ```npm i sort-table-with-binwin``` 


* After running that we need to source package named **sort-table.js** to your project like 

    ```<script src="./node_modules/sort-table-with-binwin/sort-table.js></script>```
    
 **Happy Hacking!!**
